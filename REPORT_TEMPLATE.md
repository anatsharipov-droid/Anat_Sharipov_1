## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:**  
(write your project name)

**What does your calculator do?**  
(Explain in 2–3 sentences what problem you are solving and what you calculate.)

This calculator calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) using weight and height. It also classifies the result into health categories.

---

## 2. Inputs

List and explain all inputs you used.

| Input Name | Unit | What it Represents |

## 3. Process (Calculation Logic)

**Formula or Calculation Used:**  
(Write your formula or explain how calculation works.)

Example:  
BMI = weight / (height in meters)^2

**Steps:**
1. Get input values from HTML  
2. Convert values if needed (example: cm → meters)  
3. Perform calculation  
4. Store result in variable

## 4. Conditional Logic (if / else)

Explain how your program interprets the result.

Example:

If BMI < 18.5 → Underweight  
If BMI 18.5 – 24.9 → Normal  
If BMI ≥ 25 → Overweight  

Explain why you chose these ranges (if using real model, mention it).

---

## 5. Output

What does your program show to the user?

- Calculated value  
- Category or interpretation  
- Personalized message (if used)  
- Optional: binary output (if implemented)

## 6. Edge Cases / Unusual Inputs

What happens if:

- User enters zero?  
- User enters negative number?  
- User leaves input empty?  

Explain how your program handles this.

## 7. Optional Features (If You Added Any)

Examples:
- Binary conversion  
- Extra calculations  
- Extra UI features  
- Validation messages  

---

## 8. How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone repository  
2. Open `index.html` in browser  
3. Enter input values  
4. Click calculate button
